mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below, all inflections followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in _-ed_. The preterite of _steal_ was _stealed_, the preterite of _think_ was _thinked_, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as _swam_, _gave_, _brought_, _spoke_, _taken_, etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by adding _-s_ or _-es_ as the case might be. The plurals of _man_, _ox_, _life_ were _mans_, _oxes_, _lifes_. Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding _-er_, _-est_ (_good_, _gooder_, _goodest_), irregular forms and the _more_, _most_ formation being suppressed. The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that _whom_ had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the _shall_, _should_ tenses had been dropped, all their uses being covered by _will_ and _would_. There were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly in connection with the B vocabulary. _Why_ so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay. * * * * * _The B vocabulary._ The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal short-hand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language. The B words were in all cases compound words.[2] They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the word _goodthink_, meaning, very roughly, "orthodoxy," or, if one chose to regard it as a verb, "to think in an orthodox manner." This inflected as follows: noun-verb, _goodthink_; past tense and past participle, _goodthinked_; present participle, _goodthinking_; adjective, _goodthinkful_; adverb, _goodthinkwise_; verbal noun, _goodthinker_. [Footnote 2: Compound words, such as _speakwrite_, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological color.] The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation. In the word _crimethink_ (thoughtcrime), for instance, the _think_ came second, whereas in _thinkpol_ (Thought Police) it came first, and in the latter word _police_ had lost its second syllable. Because of the greater difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example, the adjectival forms of _Minitrue_, _Minipax_, and _Miniluv_ were, respectively, _Minitruthful_, _Minipeaceful_, and _Minilovely_, simply because _-trueful_, _-paxful_, and _-loveful_ were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle, however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way. Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a _Times_ leading article as _Oldthinkers unbellyfeel Ingsoc_. The shortest rendering that one could make of this in Oldspeak would be: "Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism." But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by _Ingsoc_. And, in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word _bellyfeel_, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word _oldthink_, which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special function of certain Newspeak words, of which _oldthink_ was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they canceled by their existence. As we have already seen in the case of the word _free_, words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless other words such as _honor_, _justice_, _morality_, _internationalism_, _democracy_, _science_, and _religion_ had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words groupings themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word _crimethink_, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word _oldthink_. Greater precision would have been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshiped "false gods." He did not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like; probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah; he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat the same way, the Party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words _sexcrime_ (sexual immorality) and _goodsex_ (chastity). _Sexcrime_ covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practiced for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by _goodsex_--that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman; all else was _sexcrime_. In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it _was_ heretical; beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent. No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as _joycamp_ (forced-labor camp) or _Minipax_ (Ministry of Peace, i.e., Ministry of War) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example was _prolefeed_, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation "good" when applied to the Party and "bad" when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological color not from their meaning but from their structure. So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the
